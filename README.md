# TikTok Data Visualizer

## Overview

TikTok Data Visualizer is a React-based web application that allows users to upload their TikTok data in JSON format and visualize key information like profile details, search history, chats, and comments. The app features different pages to navigate between your TikTok activity, providing an intuitive way to explore your data.

## Features

- **Profile Page**: Displays user profile information such as username, email, birth date, and profile picture.
- **Search History**: Displays a list of previous search queries with their respective dates.
- **Chat Interface**: Visualizes chat conversations between the user and others with sortable options for "Newest to Oldest" and "Oldest to Newest."
- **Comments Page**: Shows user comments with associated dates in a clean, readable format.
- **JSON File Upload**: Upload your TikTok JSON data to populate the application with your personal information and interactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS (custom styles for the layout and chat bubbles)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState)

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: The app allows users to upload a JSON file containing TikTok data. The file is then parsed and rendered in the UI.
2. **Navigation**: The sidebar allows users to switch between different pages to view the Profile, Search History, Chats, and Comments.
3. **Sorting Chats**: Users can sort chat messages by "Newest to Oldest" or "Oldest to Newest" on the Chat page.
4. **Data Visualization**: Each section of the app visualizes the corresponding data in an easy-to-read format.
